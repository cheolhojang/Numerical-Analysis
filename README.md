# Math128A Fall 2017 with Ming Gu
Coding Files in the Numerical Analysis class with Ming Gu Fall 2017 Math128a.
Project 1: Coded a numerical method to find solution of a certain equation. I used Muller's method specifically with some modifications on the toleration and repeat numbers

Project 2: Coded a numerical method to visualize the path of a planet through differential equations. Implemented an instructor's file which already had the path of earth, moon, and the sun
